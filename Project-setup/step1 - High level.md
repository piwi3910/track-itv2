# Elevator Pitch

An internal task management platform that unifies agile sprint planning with calendar-based scheduling to provide teams with both tactical kanban boards for immediate work and strategic calendar views for long-term planning across multiple projects.

## Problem Statement

Teams struggle with fragmented productivity tools - they use separate systems for sprint planning, task tracking, and calendar scheduling. This creates visibility gaps, duplicated effort, and makes it difficult to balance immediate sprint work with longer-term strategic initiatives. Current tools force teams to choose between agile methodology focus OR calendar-based planning, but not both in a unified experience.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Internal development teams using agile methodologies
- **Secondary**: Project managers and product teams within the organization
- **Tertiary**: Cross-functional teams within the organization

## USP

The only internal task management platform that seamlessly blends SCRUM/agile workflows with calendar-based planning in a unified interface for zero-friction adoption.

## Target Platforms

- Web application (primary)
- Mobile responsive design
